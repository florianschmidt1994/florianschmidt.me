**BreakOut is a non-profit from Munich, where money is raised by travelling as far as possible in 36 hours without spending any money.**

Together with my team we developed an app, website and backend and helped raise over 300000 € in donations so far. Starting as a backend developer I helped build the infrastructure as a greenfield project. A year later my role changed and I became teamleader of our development team.

I wrote most of our Android App as a react native application and together with my amazing team we tackled scaling and reliability challenges by using modern software development practices such as continous deployments, reliable error reporting and domain driven design!

Our iOS app is written in Swift. Our Android App is written in Objective C. Backend is mostly Spring Boot and Kotlin, with some microservices written in Scala and nodeJS.

All our code and even most of our infrastructure configurations are open-source and can be found at [http://github.com/breakoutevent/](http://github.com/breakoutevent/)
