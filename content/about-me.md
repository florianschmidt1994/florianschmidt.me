title: "About Me"
---

Hi, I'm Florian and I'm currently working as a Solutions Architect at [Netlight](https://netlight.com/).
My professional life is centered around helping people to build high-performing engineering organizations, using tech
to solve real world problems and building fun stuff with cool people!

When I'm not on my laptop you can find me outdoors on skis, hikes or surfing the many river waves of Munich!

This blog is as much of a place for my personal anecdotes from live and travelling as it is a place for me
to showcase projects and assemble information from my professional live
