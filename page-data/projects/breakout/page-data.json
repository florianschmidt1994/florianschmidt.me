Starting as a backend developer I helped build the infrastructure as a greenfield project. A year later my role changed and I became teamleader of our development team.</p>\n<p>I wrote most of our Android App as a react native application and together with my amazing team we tackled scaling and reliability challenges by using modern software development practices such as continous deployments, reliable error reporting and domain driven design!</p>\n<p>Our iOS app is written in Swift. Our Android App is written in Objective C. Backend is mostly Spring Boot and Kotlin, with some microservices written in Scala and nodeJS.</p>\n<p>All our code and even most of our infrastructure configurations are open-source and can be found at <a href=\"http://github.com/breakoutevent/\">http://github.com/breakoutevent/</a></p>\n<p>If you want to know more about our software development process  check out <a href=\"http://kotlin.quintero.io\">this awesome presentation</a> by my former team mate and team leader successor Matthias Quintero!</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://kotlin.quintero.io\" width=\"100%\" height=\"400px\"></iframe>","frontmatter":{"date":"February 03, 2020","slug":"/projects/breakout","title":"BreakOut","featuredImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"id":"3270e76a-4b59-5725-b479-de73dc60fc30","frontmatter__slug":"/projects/breakout","__params":{"frontmatter__slug":"projects"}}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
