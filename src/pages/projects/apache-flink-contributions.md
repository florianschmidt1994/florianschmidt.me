At Ververica I was part of the team that develops the internals of the Apache Flink stream processing engine. My job included working with open-source collaborators and being part of a community-driven design and development process. Among my accomplishments is the implementation of an API for time-relative joins of two streams of data. For my master thesis at Ververica I designed, implemented and evaluated active replication mechanisms for Apache Flink.
